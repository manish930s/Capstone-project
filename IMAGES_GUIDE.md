## 🎤 Talking Points

### When Showing Criteria Infographic
> "As you can see, StudyCopilot implements 6 out of 9 submission criteria. The green checkmarks show our implemented features: Multi-Agent System with Gemini 2.0 Flash, Custom Tools including RAG, Sessions & Memory management, Context Engineering, Observability through logging, and full Deployment. This exceeds the minimum requirement of 3 criteria by 200%."

### When Showing Architecture Diagram
> "The system uses a dual-server microservice architecture. The main agent_app.py server handles the web interface, Gemini AI integration, RAG system, and session management. It communicates with the calendar_bridge.py service for Google Calendar operations. This separation of concerns ensures clean architecture and scalability."
